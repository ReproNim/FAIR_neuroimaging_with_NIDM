# Cerebrovascular Reactivity Normative Dataset

## Description

Fifty healthy adult subjects with no prior history of neurological or psychiatric disorder were included in this dataset.

The goal is to provide a normative dataset for the computation of maps of Cerebrovascular Reactivity Maps. For this purpose, we developed CVRmap, a BIDS-compatible pipeline to process the data. More information on CVRmap can be found on the corresponding github page:

`www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap`.

The paper describing CVRmap and this dataset can be found [here](https://rdcu.be/dCCZW).

## Rawdata

- Anatomical data: a standard T1w image was acquired for each subject.
- Functional data: each subject underwent an fMRI scan with blocs of CO2 inhalation challenges.
- Physiological data: breath CO2 was recorded using a capnograph during the fMRI acquisition.

## Derivatives

- `derivatives/fmriprep_v21.0.4`: output of fMRIPrep with the `--use-aroma` option enabled.
- `derivatives/cvrmap_2.0.20`: output of CVRmap (`www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap`), version 2.0.20.
- `derivatives/cvrmap_2.0.25`: output of CVRmap (`www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap`), version 2.0.25.
- `derivatives/cvrmap_2.0.25_gs`: output of CVRmap (`www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap`), version 2.0.25, with the global signal option.
- `derivatives/cvrmap_2.0.25_vs`: output of CVRmap (`www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap`), version 2.0.25, with the vessel signal option.

## Further analysis

Further analysis can be done using the jupyter notebook in the repository `www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap-paper`. This will produce a set of figures and perform some basic statistics on the CVR maps (age regression, grey/white matter averages, etc).
